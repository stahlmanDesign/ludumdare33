Ludum Dare 33 compo attempt


# The Theme for Ludum Dare 33 is:

- You are the Monster #LDJAM @ludumdare

#The game

- uses ImpactJS game engine (you must provide the engine which requires a license) but all other source code is here

- #idea: « Fee-fi-fo-fum ! »
- Jack and beanstalk story, but you are the **giant**
- you start sleeping and a little guy steals your golden-egg laying hen
- you chase little people down the beanstalk and kick them off or eat them
- they are trying to cut it down, so hurry
- if you get to the bottom, you go on rampage through village
- if you are on beanstalk while it's cut down, you fall and die

# update at 23:31
- decided to privately live blog (will make public later) instead of update constantly in README

#Setup
- requires the ImpactJS game engine impactjs.com
- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in localhost:3000. To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>
</ul>
