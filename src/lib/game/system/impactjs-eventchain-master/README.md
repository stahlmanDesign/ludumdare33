# impactjs-eventchain

A function to help script sequential events in [ImpactJS][].

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drhayes/impactjs-eventchain.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drhayes/impactjs-eventchain)

## Overview

Use an EventChain where you would normally use `ig.system.tick` and a bunch of counters to try and time a scripted series of events. Each link in the chain is a step in your script.

A few concrete examples:

  * Spawn a monster every 5 seconds: `wait(5).then(function() { ig.game.spawnEntity...; }).repeat()`
  * Time a player respawn: player dies, wait 3 seconds, spawn player entity: `then(this.kill).wait(3).then(function() { ig.game.spawnEntity...; })`
  * Make a crumbling platform that wobbles every once in a while before `kill`ing itself: `wait(0.3).then(this.wobble).wait(0.3).then(this.wobble).wait(0.3).then(this.kill)`

Be sure to check out my [blog post][blogpost] explaining the rationale behind this class.

## Install

  1. Download eventChain.js (either by [downloading it directly][download] or by cloning the repo).
  2. EventChain's module is declared as `game.system.eventChain`, so you need to create a `system` directory inside the `lib/game` directory of your game.
  3. Copy eventChain.js to your new `lib/game/system` directory.

To use EventChain in your code, add its full name to the `require` statement in the module you're using it in, like this:

    .require(
       // ... other modules go here ...
       'game.system.eventChain'
    ).define(//...

You should be all set.

## Usage

`EventChain` has one optional parameter: the context in which it should execute the callbacks. That way, you can write `.then(this.kill)` and the chain will Do The Right Thing. If you don't need any special context, don't pass in that param.

You probably want to create an `EventChain` in the `init` method of an entity:

    init: function(x, y, settings) {
      this.parent(x, y, settings);
      this.chain = EventChain(this)
        .wait(10)           // Wait for 10 seconds...
        .then(function() {  // ...then spawn a baddie...
            ig.game.spawnEntity('EntityKillerThing', 10, 10);
          })
        .repeat(3)          // ...repeat that 3 times...
        .wait(5)            // ...wait some more...
        .then(function() {  // ...then spawn a lesser baddie...
            ig.game.spawnEntity('EntityWeakerThing', 10, 10);
          })
        .repeat();         // ...and repeat the whole thing forever.
    },

And then invoke it in your `update` method like so:

    update: function() {
      this.chain();
    },

Event chains are also re-usable. After the last step of your chain, call the method `reset` on it like this:

    this.chain.reset();

The chain will begin again from the first step and proceed down the links.

## Mixins

If `EventChain` in its current form doesn't suit your needs, you can mixin a new function that will be part of every subsequent `EventChain` you create.

For example, say you wanted to add a `forever` function. You want to be able to do something like this: `eventChain.forever().orUntil(...)`. You can mixin that function like so:

    EventChain.mixin('forever', function(context, steps) {
      return function() {
        steps.push(function() {});
        return this;
      };
    });

All the core methods of `EventChain` are "built-in" mixins.

## Available Methods

Here's what the chain can do for you.

### `then`

    .then(callback)

The workhorse of an `EventChain`. When this link is reached your `callback` will be executed.

### `thenUntil`
    
    .thenUntil(doThis, untilThis)
    
Repeatedly calls doThis and blocks the chain until untilThis returns true.

### `waitUntil`
    
    .waitUntil(waitCondition)
    
Waits until waitCondition returns true.

### `wait`

    .wait(numberOfSeconds)

Blocks the chain until `numberOfSeconds` has elapsed. Uses `ig.system.tick` to mark the passage of time.

### `during`

    .during(callback)

Execute the `callback` during a wait. If called in an `update`, for example, will be executed every frame during a `wait`.

### `repeat`

    .repeat()
    // or
    .repeat(numberOfTimes)

Repeats all previous links in the chain `numberOfTimes` times. If not given, will repeat itself forever. `repeat`s may be nested for multiplicative fun!

### `every`

    .every(numberOfSeconds, callback)

Much like `during`, only useful when used after a `wait`. Every `numberOfSeconds` seconds it will execute the `callback`.

### `orUntil`

    .orUntil(predicate)

`predicate` is a function that returns `true` or `false`. Only useful when used after a `wait`. Will "break" the wait if the `predicate` returns `true`.

### `waitForAnimation`

    .waitForAnimation([animation, ][, times])

`animation` is an instance of ImpactJS' [Animation][] type. `times` is a number of times for the animation to
repeat. Both are optional. You can call `waitForAnimation` like this:

    var chain = EventChain(this)
      .waitForAnimation()
      .then(function() {});

...and, assuming `this` refers to an instance of Entity, it will wait for the current animation to complete.

You can also do this:

    var chain = EventChain()
      .waitForAnimation(randomAnimation, 3)
      .then(function() {});

...which will wait for `randomAnimation` to run 3 times before continuing on.

You can also do this:

    var chain = EventChain(this)
      .waitForAnimation(42)
      .then(function() {});

...which will wait for the `currentAnim` to play 42 times before continuing.
